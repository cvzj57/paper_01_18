The X-ray structure of the deep red, highly luminescent 4 shows it to be a D2-symmetric molecule with an end-to-end twist of 97A$^{\circ}$. The central acene is encapsulated by the peripheral phenyl substituents, and as a result, the molecule is relatively unreactive and even displays reversible electrochemical oxidation and reduction.},

In this method, a set of hybrid orbitals is placed on the boundary atom between the QM and MM fragments, and one of the hybrid orbitals participates in the SCF calculation for the atoms in the QM region. The GHO method provides a well-defined potential energy surface for a hybrid QM/MM system and is a significant improvement over the â€œlink-atomâ€ approach by saturating the QM valencies with hydrogen atoms. The method has been tested on small molecules and yields reasonable structural, energetic, and electronic results in comparison with the results of the corresponding QM and MM approximations. The GHO method will greatly increase the applicability of combined QM/MM methods to systems comprising large molecules, such as proteins.},

It allows quantum electronic computations on a fragment of a large molecule mostly depicted by a classical force field. The bond separating the quantum subsystem from the classical one is assumed to be represented by localized orbitals introduced as data. The molecular orbitals of this subsystem are developed on a basis of functions, orthogonal to the localized orbitals, which derive from the atomic orbitals of the usual basis set by a simple linear transformation. The algorithm of the LSCF method is obtained by a simple modification of the standard Hartree-Fock or DFT codes.},

To this end, we calibrate DCACPâ€™s in order to reproduce the equilibrium distance and binding energy of MP2 potential energy surfaces of the weakly bonded homodimers Ar2, Kr2, and (Br2)2. In all cases studied, using DFT with the generalized gradient approximation functional BLYP and the DCACPâ€™s, the influence of dispersion forces on equilibrium and transition-state geometries, interaction energies, and transition barriers can be reproduced in good agreement with MP2 calculations and without any significant increase in computational cost. The transferability of the DCACPâ€™s to other systems is assessed by addressing various weakly bonded complexes. We investigate (i) ideal van der Waals clusters of the type ArnKrm (âˆ€n,m=\{0,1,2,3,4\} and 2â©½n+mâ©½4), (ii) the effect of DCACPâ€™s on covalent bonds and conformers of the hydrocarbon molecule cyclooctatetraene which features a system of Ï€ bonds, and (iii) the competition of simultaneous electrostatic and dispersion forces for the equilibrium structure and transition states of the hydrogen bromide dimer (HBr)2. In all cases, the performance of the DCACPâ€™s to these extended set of systems is remarkably good.},

Because of this property, the application of the nonlocal part of the pseudopotential to a wave function can be done efficiently on a grid in real space. Real space integration is much faster for large systems than ordinary multiplication in Fourier space, since it shows only quadratic scaling with respect to the size of the system.

This is mostly due to the fact that it is fairly convenient to implement and parametrize, thus providing an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational effort. In this work, a viable and straight-forward approach to optimize the placing of the link atom on a suitable distance ratio between the frontier atoms is discussed. To further increase the accuracy, instead of global parameters for all amino acids, different parameter sets for each type of amino acid are derived. The dependency of the link bond parameters on the chemical environment and the used QM-method is probed to assess the range of applicability of the parametrization. Suitable sets of parameters for RI-MP2, B3LYP, (RI)-B3LYP-D3, and RI-BLYP-D3 at triple-zeta level for all relevant proteinogenic amino acids are presented. Furthermore, the scope and range of the perturbation, stemming from the introduction of link bonds is evaluated through application of the presented QM/MM scheme in calculations of the active site of 15S-lipoxygenase.

Parameters are obtained through minimisation of a penalty functional that explicitly encodes hybrid DFT forces and static polarisabilities of reference molecules. For hydrogen, fluorine, chlorine and carbon the respective reference molecules consist of H-2, F-2, Cl-2 and CH4. The transferability of this approach is assessed for harmonic frequencies in a small set of chlorofluorocarbon molecules. Numerical evidence, gathered for CF4, CCl4, CCl3F, CCl2F2, CClF3, ClF, HF, HCl, CFH3, CF2H2, CF3H, CHCl3, CH2Cl2 and CH3Cl indicates that the GGA+FCACP level of theory yields harmonic frequencies that are significantly more consistent with hybrid DFT values, as well as slightly reduced molecular polarisability.},
